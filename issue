**Description**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

I've tested the same code on a Jaspr project which makes use of jaspr_tailwind and a separate TailwindCSS project but I am receiving inconsistent behaviour in terms of how the web page looks with Jaspr and how it looks with TailwindCSS

**Jaspr**

**TailwindCSS**
